Google's HTML5 port of Bytonic Software's Java port of Id Software's Quake II

To install and run: http://http://code.google.com/p/quake2-gwt-port/wiki/BuildingAndRunning
Eclipse setup: http://http://code.google.com/p/quake2-gwt-port/wiki/EclipseSetup

====================================================================================================

If you have trouble with the automated downloading of the "q2-314-demo-x86.exe" file from Ant, you 
can download manually (either into your ~/Downloads or into the top directory of quake2-gwt-port)
and it will be used. You will probably need to execute Ant target "clean-resources" otherwise the 
Ant build script will imagine that you downloaded and unpacked the demo exe sucessfully.

Try this:

  $ curl -O ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake2/q2-314-demo-x86.exe
  $ ant clean clean-resources run
